# Goal

Predict the method of weight lifting used given data collected from popular exercise trackers.

## Motivation

The popularity of wearable fitness trackers seems to be an indication of common focus on personal
health, but most trackers simply measure the amount of exercise.  There is also evidence to suggest
that not all exercise is created equal, not only can improper exercise mechanics be less effective
then proper mechanice improper exercise can even cause increased pain or injury
(see: [University of Maryland Medical Center - Exercise Report](http://umm.edu/health/medical/reports/articles/exercise)).

Therefore being able to distinguish between proper and improper exercise techniques provides
valuable information for people who wish to improve their health.

# Approach

Use data collected for this paper: [Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/work.jsf?p1=11201),
to determine if there is a reliable way to identify the differen techniques used.  A more
detailed description of the approach can be found here: [Human Activity Recognition](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har),
under the "Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset" section.

# Notice

You may notice that I am not using the R engine for executing R code in this document.  The software
I am using aborts any time the render process attempts to run R code.  As a result, I will be executing
the R code manually and copying any relevant output to this document.

This also means I will be unable to provide any graphs or plots used in my analysis.  I will do my
best to describe the important aspects of any graphs or plots during my investigation.

# Data Exploration

The first step in making our predictions is to understand the data we have to work with.

## What's in the Data

### Summarize the Data

```
training <- read.csv("data/pml-training.csv")
dim(training)
summary(training)
```

Output:
```
[1] 19622   160
```

I have ommitted the full summary output because there are 160 columns of data.  The number of columns
is also the first challenge for this dataset.  Since I am not an expert in exercise mechanics I will
need to either use an unsupervised learning technique, or I will need to lever some additional tools
to focus my data exploration efforts.

### Prediction Focus

Looking at the type of data we are predicting:
```
str(training$classe)
```

Output:
```
 Factor w/ 5 levels "A","B","C","D",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
```

The take away here is that the form of the output data is already factored.  This simply means that
we need to neither create factors nor evaluate using a root mean squared (or similar metric).

### Data and Time

The primary question we want to answer here is whether or not data points need to be analyzed in
temporally contiguous blocks.
